# Erin's Projects
Hello! This repository features projects I completed during my time as a Data Science major (and Web Programming and Applications minor) at NYU.

Representative projects are listed below from most to least recent, with the respective course title and a brief description of what was accomplished/what libraries and methods were used.
All projects/assignments are organized by academic year and course title.

## [Fundamentals of Machine Learning, Spring 2023](<2022-23/fundamentals of machine learning/Capstone Project>)
Building a classification algorithm that predicts music genres using audio features from Spotify API, and performing dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis.
* Python pandas, matplotlib, sklearn (preprocessing, model_selection), decomposition, manifold, tree, ensemble, metrics)
* PCA, K-means clustering with Silhouette method, random forest, AdaBoost
* Data cleaning; evaluation with AUROC and accuracy score

## [Machine Learning for Climate, Spring 2023](<2022-23/machine learning for climate>)
Building a machine learning model that predicts demand for bakery products in order to decrease emissions from food waste, with the best model selected through a performance comparison of several different models.
* Python pandas, matplotlib, sklearn (preprocessing, model_selection, linear_model, tree, ensemble, metrics), xgboost
* Linear regression, ridge, lasso, XGBoost, Bagging, AdaBoost
* Data cleaning and extraction; evaluation with RMSLE, MAE, MedAE, MAPE

## [Data Management and Analysis, Fall 2021](<2021-22/data management and analysis>)
Querying PostgreSQL databases to retrieve, join, and analyze data (Assignments 5-7)
*	Using select statements with clauses: where, order by, group by, having, aggregate functions, joins
* Exploring primary keys, functional dependencies, views

## [Responsible Data Science, Spring 2021](<2020-21/responsible data science>)
Nutritional label (fairness evaluation) for a decision system that predicts loan default risk. 
* In audited code: Python numpy, pandas, sklearn (preprocessing, impute, random forest), matplotlib, seaborn
* In additionally implemented code: Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, aif360 (IBM fairness toolkit), sklearn (preprocessing, impute, random forest, metrics), LIME
* Evaluation with accuracy, disparate impact, false positive/negative rates

## [Introduction to Data Science, Fall 2020](<2020-21/introduction to data science>)
Analysis of NYC middle school data from the NYC Department of Education for predicting specialized high school admission.
* Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats
* Feature encoding, correlation, R-squared, PCA, t-test, multiple regression

## [Data Science for Everyone Project, Spring 2020](<2019-20/Erin Choi DS4E Final Project.pdf>)
Data and regression analysis of Spotify song data for relationships between song qualities such as valence and danceability. (Only the PDF is included as I no longer have access to the original notebook.)
* Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels.api
* Hypothesis testing, OLS regression analysis, bias evaluation

## Miscellaneous Assignments
### [Fundamentals of Machine Learning, Spring 2023](<2022-23/fundamentals of machine learning>)
A series of assignments that involve application of machine learning techniques to perform supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn (preprocessing, metrics, linear_model, model_selection, ensemble), PyTorch
* Linear regression, ridge, lasso, logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, feedforward neural networks, PCA, TSNE, MDS, K-means with Silhouette method, DBSCAN

### [Causal Inference, Fall 2022](<2022-23/causal inference>)
A series of assignments that demonstrate understanding of causal inference topics and cleaning and analyzing data in R.

## Web Design and Development Projects:
### [The Recessionary Ranch - Group Final Project for Interactive Computing course](https://github.com/tangym27/recessionary-ranch), Fall 2022
  * Created with Michelle Tang and Tiffany (Thinzar) Lin
 
### [Portfolio website created for Introduction to Web Design course](https://github.com/erinchoi2001/erinchoi2001.github.io), Fall 2021
