# Projects
Hello! This repository features projects I completed during my time as a Data Science major and Web Programming and Applications minor at NYU.

Projects are organized by school year and course.

## 2019-20
### Data Science for Everyone Project, Spring 2020
Data and regression analysis of Spotify song data for relationships between song qualities such as valence and danceability. (Only the PDF is included as I no longer have access to the original notebook.)
* Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels.api

## 2020-21
### Introduction to Data Science, Fall 2020
Analysis of NYC middle school data from the NYC Department of Education for predicting specialized high school admission.
* Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats

### Responsible Data Science, Spring 2021
Nutritional label for a decision system that predicts loan default risk. 
* In audited code: Python numpy, pandas, sklearn (preprocessing, impute, random forest), matplotlib, seaborn
* In additionally implemented code: Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, aif360 (IBM's fairness toolkit), sklearn (preprocessing, impute, random forest, metrics), lime

## 2021-22
### Data Management and Analysis, Fall 2021
A series of assignments that involve preprocessing, joining, viewing, and analyzing data and databases in Python and PostgreSQL.
* Python: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, re, json

## 2022-23
### Causal Inference, Fall 2022
A series of assignments that involve demonstrating understanding of causal inference topics and cleaning and analyzing data in R.

### Fundamentals of Machine Learning, Spring 2023
A series of assignment that involve application of machine learning techniques to perform supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Python numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn (preprocessing, metrics, linear_model, model_selection, ensemble)
* Linear regression, ridge, lasso, logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, more to come
